            <span ><b>Project1 </b>One of my significant projects involved developing a deep learning-based skin lesion multi-class classification model aimed at accurately diagnosing various types of skin lesions. The project utilized a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model, which was carefully designed to improve classification performance through the integration of Global Average Pooling. By training and testing the model on a comprehensive dataset, I achieved superior accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art CNN models. The project’s success led to its publication as a research paper in Springer, demonstrating the model's effectiveness and practical application in medical image analysis.</span>
