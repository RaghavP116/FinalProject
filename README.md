Fitness Exercises – Interactive Workout Guide (Vue.js)
An interactive fitness exercise web application built using Vue.js that dynamically fetches and displays workout exercises from a REST API. The application provides a clean, component-based UI where users can explore exercises and expand detailed workout instructions.

Tech Stack
  1. Vue.js – Component-based frontend architecture
     
  2.JavaScript (ES6+) – Application logic and state handling
  
  3.REST API – Dynamic exercise data fetching
  
  4.CSS3 – Responsive layout and modern styling

Key Features
  1.Reusable Vue Components
    Modular components such as GymHeader, ExerciseCard, ExerciseOverview, and ExerciseDetails ensure clean separation of concerns and maintainability.
    
  2.API-Driven Content
    Exercise data is fetched asynchronously from a backend API, enabling dynamic updates without hardcoded content.
    
  3.Expandable Exercise Cards
    Each exercise card supports toggle-based expansion to reveal:

Step-by-step instructions
Warm-up routines
Exercise benefits

Centralized State Handling
Uses controlled state (expandedExercise) to ensure only one exercise expands at a time, improving user experience.

Clean & Responsive UI
Styled with modern CSS and grid-based layouts to ensure readability and responsiveness across devices.

Purpose of the Project
This project demonstrates:
Practical use of Vue.js component communication (props & events)
Asynchronous API integration using fetch
Scalable frontend architecture for real-world applications
UI/UX patterns for interactive content display

Ideal For

Frontend development portfolios
Vue.js learning projects
Fitness or health-related web applications
