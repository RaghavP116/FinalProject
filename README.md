Fitness Exercises – Interactive Workout Guide (Vue.js)

An interactive fitness exercise web application built using Vue.js that dynamically fetches and displays workout exercises from a REST API. The application provides a clean, component-based UI where users can explore exercises and expand detailed workout instructions.

Tech Stack

Vue.js – Component-based frontend architecture
JavaScript (ES6+) – Application logic and state handling
REST API – Dynamic exercise data fetching
CSS3 – Responsive layout and modern styling

Key Features

Reusable Vue Components
Modular components such as GymHeader, ExerciseCard, ExerciseOverview, and ExerciseDetails ensure clean separation of concerns and maintainability.

API-Driven Content
Exercise data is fetched asynchronously from a backend API, enabling dynamic updates without hardcoded content.

Expandable Exercise Cards
Each exercise card supports toggle-based expansion to reveal step-by-step instructions, warm-up routines, and exercise benefits.

Centralized State Handling
Uses controlled state (expandedExercise) to ensure only one exercise expands at a time, improving user experience.

Clean & Responsive UI
Styled with modern CSS and grid-based layouts to ensure readability and responsiveness across devices.

Purpose of the Project

This project demonstrates practical use of Vue.js component communication (props & events), asynchronous API integration using fetch, scalable frontend architecture for real-world applications, and effective UI/UX patterns for interactive content display.

Ideal For

Frontend development portfolios, Vue.js learning projects, and fitness or health-related web applications.
