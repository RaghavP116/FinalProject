Fitness Exercises – Interactive Workout Guide (Vue.js)

A full-stack fitness exercise guide built with Vue.js and Node.js, designed to display a comprehensive list of workout exercises with detailed instructions. The application fetches exercise data from a backend API connected to MongoDB and presents it in a clean, user-friendly card layout.

Each exercise includes muscle group, equipment, difficulty level, step-by-step instructions, warm-up routines, benefits, and visual references. Users can expand or collapse exercise details dynamically for a smooth browsing experience.

This project demonstrates full-stack development concepts including API creation, database integration, asynchronous data fetching, and modern frontend architecture.

Tech Stack

Vue.js – Component-based frontend architecture
JavaScript (ES6+) – Application logic and state handling
REST API – Dynamic exercise data fetching
CSS3 – Responsive layout and modern styling

Key Features

Reusable Vue Components
Modular components such as GymHeader, ExerciseCard, ExerciseOverview, and ExerciseDetails ensure clean separation of concerns and maintainability.

API-Driven Content
Exercise data is fetched asynchronously from a backend API, enabling dynamic updates without hardcoded content.

Expandable Exercise Cards
Each exercise card supports toggle-based expansion to reveal step-by-step instructions, warm-up routines, and exercise benefits.

Centralized State Handling
Uses controlled state (expandedExercise) to ensure only one exercise expands at a time, improving user experience.

Clean & Responsive UI
Styled with modern CSS and grid-based layouts to ensure readability and responsiveness across devices.
